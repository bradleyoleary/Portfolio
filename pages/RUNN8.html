      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I conducted a competitive analysis of similar platforms that have a huge
        influence in the ride-sharing industry such as Uber, Lyft, Curb, etc. I
        concluded that a clear product goal and minimalist design and is the key
        for high conversion rates in regards to sign-ups.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Who am I designing for?</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I created a persona based on a user scenario. I truly enjoy creating
        personas, as it gives me the ability to see through the eyes of the user
        and prioritize what matters most in terms of usability.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Looking back at my design goal, I knew a simplistic layout for the
        homepage will be very important for the user demographic of RUNN8. Short
        text with plenty of CTA's are placed on the landing page, saving the
        more in depth content for informational pages such as Our Company and
        Safety.

        â€¢ Deploy a survey to gain a more in depth knowledge of end users needs

      <p class="projectText">â€¢ More usability testing</p>

        â€¢ Create a user flow for the highest priority pages
