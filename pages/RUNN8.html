        encourages users to sign up.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I conducted a competitive analysis of similar platforms who have a huge
        influence in the ride-sharing industry such as Uber, Lyft, Curb, etc. I
        came to the conclusion that promptly displaying what the product is
        about is key for users so sign up.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Who am I designing for?</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I created a persona based on a user scenario. I love creating personas,
        as it gives me the ability to see through the eyes of the user and
        prioritize what matters most.
      </p>

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px" />
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I really wanted to focus on the users and how they can effectively buy
        and sell automotive products in the most simple way possible. The less
        steps to complete a task, the less errors. Keeping a minimalist design
        was key to having an effective and usable interface.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Mockup</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I wanted to create an attractive, clean, and easy to navigate interface
        that users can quickly and effectively use right off the bat. The rich
        blue colour compliments many areas of the design while highlighting some
        of the key functional features for improved usability and navigation.
        The prominent colour also gives the app identity users can become
        familiar with.

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px" />
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Future Considerations</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Although I would have liked to user test with a larger demographic of
        users to gain a better understanding of who I am designing for, it was a
        great exercise that enabled me to understand how to effectively use UX
        principles to create an effective and engaging interface.
