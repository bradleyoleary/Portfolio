      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Overview</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        As a car enthusiast I’m typically browsing the internet on different
        forums and blogs to check out whats new in the automotive world. I love
        BMW’s, so the website I’m on the most is Bimmerpost. It’s an awesome
        website for BMW enthusiasts to share news and articles about their cars
        and new articles at anytime. 
        <p class="projectText">The problem I have with Bimmerpost, like many other automotive
          enthusiast websites, is the design. It’s difficult to
          navigate, it’s cluttered, and it’s a bit ugly. Here is an screenshot of the current website:</p><img
          src="/img/bimmerpostSite.png"
          alt="Website Image"
          class="projectImageMedium"
        />
      </p>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Problem</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        The current homepage is quite messy. It needs to be evaluated in regards to
        website navigation, information hierarchy, and overall design aesthetic.
      </p>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Design Objective</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I knew creating a new and refreshing homepage for the website that would
        keep an authentic BMW feel users are looking for would be tough. I
        wanted to have a design that was clean, easy to use, and is attractive
        for new and current users.
      </p>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Results</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Developed a wireframe and mockup UI of the Bimmerpost landing page by
        implementing numerous UX strategies.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I researched a variety of different websites similar to Bimmerpost (AudiWorld, MBWorld, etc.) and noticed the same design and usability
        issues on each. I’ve come to the conclusion that the majority of
        automotive forum/blogs are typically not designed with users in mind and
        are outdated in terms of visual design.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        After a few rough sketches of how I think the layout should
        be, I created a wireframe. My goal with the wireframe was to clearly
        illustrate an ideal and simple layout of how the homepage should be. In
        my opinion, content heavy websites like Bimmerpost should be a breeze to
        navigate and access information quickly. </p>
        
        <p class="projectText">The naviagtion bar at the
        top of the page, along with the log in and register buttons, were of
        upmost importance when creating the wireframe. I want users to know
        where they are on the website at all times and easily be able to access
        where they would like to go at any time. Relevant and recent articles
        are listed directly on the homepage, so users can browse the most recent
        content.</p>

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Mockup</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Of course, Bimmerpost is already a beloved website by many BMW
        enthusiasts. I wanted to change the homepage, but not make it unfamiliar
        to current users. I kept this in mind when creating the mockup for the
        homepage.

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px"/>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Future Considerations</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        • Add more CTA’s throughout the homepage to encourage users to sign up 
      </p>
      <p class="projectText"> • User testing with more high-priority screens</p>
