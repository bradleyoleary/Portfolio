      <p class="projectText">
        DasWearables is a fictitious e-commerce website that sells a variety of
        wearable products. This was a group project that I and 3 other students
        created while attending the Full-Stack Development program at Concordia
        University.
      </p>

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Explanation</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Utilizing static data provided by instructors (products, companies
        etc.), my group had to create an e-commerce website from scratch. All of
        the work was taken on with each team member having specific tasks to
        complete, from developing the frontend to the backend.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Group Objective</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        As this was our first time working in a group setting, our main goal was
        to stay extremely organized and communicate efficiently with the team.
        During the entirety of the project, we used a Trello to spread the
        responsibility of tasks, and set up daily calls to track progress of our
        work.
      </p>
      <p class="projectText">
        Our clear communication during the duration of the project aloud us to
        create a polished and usable website for users to purchase products. I
        found this to be a fantastic learning experience, as this was all our
        first time developing a project in a group setting!

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Future Considerations</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        • Implement user authentication for users to sign in and out 
      </p>
      <p class="projectText">
        • Implement pagination on the homepage 
      </p>
      <p class="projectText"> • Utilize a separate page for the cart for a cleaner UI and better user experience</p>
