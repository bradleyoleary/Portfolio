      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Overview</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Covet Automotive is a marketplace for consumers looking to get
        authentic, quality, curated used automotive parts and products. This was
        a college assignment that turned into a personal project to practice my
        UX and UI design skills.
      </p>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Design Objective</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Introducing an application that can curate and organize users to buy and
        sell a variety of automotive products is fairly unique within its self.
        So, coming up with a unique and original interface that is extremely
        user friendly proved to be a challenge.
      </p>

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Results</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Created the high-fidelity designs of highest priority screens that
        effectively highlight the user journey.

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Research & Analysis</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I began with conducting research on numerous consignment appâ€™s and
        automotive e-commerce websites so I can formulate design users are
        familiar with while establishing a unique look and feel. With that being
        said, I first and foremost wanted the app to be functional without any
        friction or confusion.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Persona</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I created a persona and task flow based on a user scenario. This gave me
        the ability to understand the users point of view, especially in the
        preliminary designs of the highest priority screens.
      </p>

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px" />
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Wireframe</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I really wanted to focus on the users and how they can effectively buy
        and sell automotive products in the most simple way possible. The less
        steps to complete a task, the less errors. Keeping a minimalist design
        was key to having an effective and usable interface.
      </p>

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px" />

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Mockup</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        I wanted to create an attractive, clean, and easy to navigate interface
        that users can quickly and effectively use right off the bat. The rich
        blue colour compliments many areas of the design while highlighting some
        of the key functional features for improved usability and navigation.
        The prominent colour also gives the app identity users can become
        familiar with.

      <hr style="margin-top: 50px" />
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Future Considerations</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Although I would have liked to user test with a larger demographic of
        users to gain a better understanding of who I am designing for, it was a
        great exercise that enabled me to understand how to effectively use UX
        principles to create an effective and engaging interface.
