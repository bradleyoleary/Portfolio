      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Overview & Project Goals</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        QwikNews is a news application that focuses on quick and easy media
        consumption. The goal for this project was to create an easy to use,
        functional mobile application for users to access, filter, and save news
        articles.
      </p>
      <p class="projectText">
        This was the final project during my time at Concordia Bootcamps, and I
        thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing and developing an
        application from scratch!
      </p>
      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Explanation</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Using the highly popular NewsAPI, I was able to retrieve real time news
        from sources all over the world. One a user has created a profile, they
        have the ability to remove, share, and bookmark articles. Users also
        have the ability to filter the articles based on the source and the
        category, along with the ability to search via a keyword. To see more on
        how the app works, please view the demo below:

      <h2 class="projectSubtitle">Design Objective</h2>
      <p class="projectText">
        Taking inspiration from a variety of different apps on the market, I
        wanted the main page of the app to be quite minimalist in its design. I
        kept the interface features and content prominent with minimal
        distractions so the user can complete each task with ease.
